Day - 11:-

Collection frameworks :-

    List               Set                  Map
-->Arraylist      -->HashSet           -->Hashmap 
-->Linkedlist     -->LinkedHashSet     -->LinkedHashmap 
-->Vector         -->TreeSet           -->Treemap 

List, SEt ,Map , these are interfaces
rest of the elements are classes

Interface contains incomplete methods 
classes contains complete methods

LIST : 
- List contains ordered elements and which can accepts duplicates 

- Array List is a dynamic array which can expand its size dynamically by 1.5 times 

- Vector is also a dynamic array which can expands its size dynamically by 2 times.

- Linked list is a collection similar type of element in random allocation.

- Set , element are unorder and we don't accept duplicate .

- last set is a class which is used to store set elements.

- As set is unorder if use treeset , the elements will be order.

Maps :-
- Maps contains key value pairs  and to store key value pairs will use hashmap.

- Set and map are used to get the result in big 0 of 1 time coomplexity or constany time complexity.

- In sets and maps we don't have index values just like arrays.

- We can't use simple for loop , we have to use for each loop.



list<Integer>  list = new ArrayList<> ();

Set<Integer>  st = new Hashset <> ();

map <Integer, Integer> mp =  new Hashmap<>();
