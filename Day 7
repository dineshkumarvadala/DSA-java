Problem Solving :-

stacks 
last in first out(LIFO)
Push() - add elements in the stack
pop() - removing the last element
peek() - print the top most element 


Next Greater Element (more over in stack) :- 
|  1  |
|  4  |
|  3  |
|__2__|


Array having fixed size , we can't increase the size as well we can't decrease , if array size is 5 maximum image store 5 elements we want store 6th element we have to create one more array with 
the extra space , but we can't increase the size.
But in array list the size will be dynamic , you can increase the size aswellas decrease .

class Main{
    public static void main(String []args){
        List<Wraper class of list type > ArrayListName = new ArrayList <> ();
        List<Integer>arr = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}

- List is an interface and angular brackets are henric array.
- Array list is belongs to collection frameworks and we have to use wraper class  in  collections, followed array list name, array which your mentioned in syntax in class
- Interface contains incomplete methods and class contains complete method .
- As array list is a class we have to import array list class .

Code:-
import java.util.*;
class Main{
    public static void main(String []args){
        List<Integer> Leaders = new ArrayList <> ();
       
        int[]arr = {5,6,2,8,2,6};
        int max =  Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = arr.length- 1; i >=0 ; i--){
            if (arr[i] > max){
                Leaders.add(arr[i]);
                max = arr[i];
            }
        }
        Collections.reverse(Leaders);
        System.out.print(Leaders);
    }
}


In Array list , if the array got instailize size 2 , if we are trying to add 3rd element the size of the list we be doubled and if size of array  is four if we are trying add 4 ,
Again size doubled 8 and vise versa is 8. And if we remove  4 element out of 8 and if we try to remove 5th element th array will be Half.
arr[4] = 1,2,3,4 5th element added 
size will be arr[8]
arr[8] = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
arr[4].

Greddy Algorithm:-

Custom sorting:-
If it sorting we have only two possiblities either ascending or desending , when it comes to custom sortin we can sort the value s according to our format.

Ascending order - 19,26,37.
Desencing order - 37,26,19. 

Custom sorting - 26,37,19 (unit wise) .

- From given arrays make pairs  
- sort the array based on nth type.

After for sure we will take first meeting , compare nth time to starting time of next pair , if staring time strictly greater , consider the meeting .
